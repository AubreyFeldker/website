description: "Single-page React application allowing users to post images across different login sessions."
---

Built with Sai Motukuri for our Web Development class with a feature set built off a series of simulated user stories. The application is built off the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), with user data being stored in MongoDB to allow for user activity to be shown across different logged-in sessions. Express session is utilized to preserve log-in across different page states, after an encrypted log-in.
